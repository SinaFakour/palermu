The Arabic version is designed by [Sina Fakour](https://www.sinafakour.com/). You can read more about the project [here](https://github.com/SinaFakour/palermu)
Sina Fakour is a visual artist, graphic and type designer based in France. 

The Latin version (League Gothic) is designed and contributed to the Open Source Type Movement by [Caroline Hadilaksono](https://www.hadilaksono.com/), [Micah Rich](https://micahrich.com/), & [Tyler Finck](https://www.tylerfinck.com/). It is a revival of an old classic, Alternate Gothic #1.
It was originally designed by [Morris Fuller Benton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Fuller_Benton) for the [American Type Founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Type_Founders) Company in 1903. The company went bankrupt in 1993, and since the original typeface was created over 95 years ago, the typeface is in the public domain.
